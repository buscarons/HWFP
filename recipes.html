                    <ol class="recipe-preparation">
                        <li><span class="bold">Sauté Aromatics:</span> Finely dice the onion, carrot, and celery (this is called a soffritto). Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the diced vegetables and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Brown Meat:</span> Add the ground meat to the pot. Break it apart with a spoon and cook, stirring, until it's browned all over. Drain off any excess fat if necessary.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Deglaze & Add Tomatoes:</span> If using red wine, pour it into the pot and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom. Let the wine simmer and reduce by about half. Stir in the crushed tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Simmer Sauce:</span> Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it cook for at least 30-45 minutes, or ideally 1-2 hours if you have the time, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the more flavorful it will become.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Cook Pasta:</span> About 15 minutes before the sauce is ready, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a rolling boil. Add the pappardelle pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite).</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Combine & Serve:</span> Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta. Add the drained pasta directly to the pot with the meat sauce. Toss everything together to coat the pasta well. If the sauce seems too thick, add a splash or two of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Garnish & Enjoy:</span> Serve immediately in bowls, garnished with freshly chopped parsley and a generous grating of Parmesan cheese.</li>

                    <h3 class="preparation-title">Preparation</h3>
                    <ol class="recipe-preparation">
                        <li><span class="bold">Prepare Pie Crust:</span> If making from scratch, combine flour, salt, and cold cubed butter until crumbly. Gradually add ice water until dough just comes together. Divide in half, flatten into discs, wrap, and chill for at least 30 minutes. (Alternatively, use store-bought refrigerated pie crusts.)</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Make Apple Filling:</span> Peel, core, and slice the apples (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick). In a large bowl, toss the apple slices with sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg (if using), and a pinch of salt. Add a squeeze of lemon juice if desired to prevent browning and add a bit of tartness. You can also dot the top of the filling with small pieces of butter before adding the top crust.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Assemble Bottom Crust:</span> Preheat your oven (typically around 375-425°F or 190-220°C, check your specific recipe). On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc of pie dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Carefully transfer it to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the edges, leaving about a 1-inch overhang.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Add Filling:</span> Pour the apple filling into the pie crust-lined plate, mounding it slightly in the center.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Create Lattice Top:</span> Roll out the second disc of pie dough. Cut it into even strips (about 3/4 to 1 inch wide). Lay half the strips evenly spaced across the top of the filling. Fold back every other strip. Place a perpendicular strip in the center. Unfold the folded strips. Now fold back the alternate strips (the ones you didn't fold before) and lay another perpendicular strip. Continue this weaving process until the top is covered in a lattice pattern.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Crimp Edges:</span> Trim the lattice strips even with the bottom crust overhang. Fold the overhang over the ends of the lattice strips and crimp the edges decoratively (e.g., with a fork or your fingers).</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Egg Wash (Optional) & Bake:</span> For a golden, shiny crust, whisk an egg with a tablespoon of water or milk and brush it lightly over the lattice and edges. You can also sprinkle with a little extra sugar. Place the pie on a baking sheet (to catch any drips).</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Bake:</span> Bake for about 45-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. You may need to cover the edges of the crust with foil partway through baking if they start to brown too quickly.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Cool:</span> Let the pie cool on a wire rack for at least 2-3 hours before slicing and serving. This allows the filling to set properly. Enjoy!</li>

                        <li><span class="bold">Roast Vegetables:</span> Preheat oven (around 400°F/200°C). Halve bell peppers, remove seeds and membranes. You can also roughly chop an onion. Toss peppers (and onion if roasting) with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on a baking sheet until softened and slightly charred (about 20-30 minutes). If using fresh tomatoes, you can roast them alongside.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Sauté Aromatics:</span> While peppers roast (or if you didn't roast onion), heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chopped onion (if not roasted) and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Combine & Simmer:</span> Once roasted, roughly chop the bell peppers (you can peel them if desired after roasting, once cool enough to handle). Add the roasted peppers, tomatoes (canned or roasted), and vegetable broth to the pot. Add smoked paprika if using. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat and cook for 10-15 minutes to allow flavors to meld.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Blend Soup:</span> Carefully transfer the soup to a blender (or use an immersion blender directly in the pot) and blend until smooth and creamy. If using a standard blender, work in batches and be cautious with hot liquids.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Add Cream & Season:</span> Return the blended soup to the pot if necessary. Stir in the cream (or coconut cream for a vegan option). Heat through gently, but do not boil. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Serve & Garnish:</span> Ladle the hot soup into bowls. Garnish with a swirl of extra cream or yogurt, a sprinkle of pumpkin seeds, freshly chopped parsley (or cilantro), and a crack of black pepper. Enjoy!</li>
